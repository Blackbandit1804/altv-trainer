# altv-trainer
**altv-trainer** is a general-purpose menu built on [NativeUI](https://github.com/DurtyFree/alt-V-NativeUI) designed for [alt:V](https://altv.mp/#/). It includes many options to help you debug your scripts or just mess around with your friends. It is **not** supposed to be an admin menu `(for now)`.
